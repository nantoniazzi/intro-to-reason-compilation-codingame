# 7 - Compile to JavaScript

Would you like some sweet, sweet interop with the JS ecosystem?

We're gonna use [BuckleScript](https://github.com/bloomberg/bucklescript), an OCaml-to-JS compiler that emits [really](https://github.com/bloomberg/bucklescript#output), [really](https://github.com/bloomberg/bucklescript-addons) clean output.

The other option is [js_of_ocaml](http://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/), a mature and battle-tested compiler.

We're gonna use real third-party dependencies this time around. Check the new package.json's `dependencies` field (a reason binding to JS functions) and `devDependencies` field (BuckleScript compiler). `npm install` in the current directory to get them.

Making this work is surprisingly simple. See the updated `run.sh`. We've also made modifications to `.gitignore` and `.merlin`.

**Make sure you read the compiled output**. Yes, read it. Trust us on this one!
